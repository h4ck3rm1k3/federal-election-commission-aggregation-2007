    retained in the Democratic National Committee Victory Fund account and these funds
    will be transferred to the New York State Democratic Committee sometime in 2007.  This
    explains why the memo entries for Schedule A, Line 12 for the fourth quarter of
    2006 (Pre-General, Post-General and Year-End Reports) are higher than the transfers
    received during this same period; the Committee discloses memo entries quarterly,
    not monthly, based upon contributions received by the Democratic National Committee
    during that quarter."'
