    value: Amending 30 Day General Report (amended October 29th) in response to telephone
      conversation with FEC Campaign Analyst to clarify two Transfers ins from the
      DNC for MD Party Victory Fund. The transfers in relate to the Memo Schedules
      for MD Party Victory Fund reported in the October Monthly for September activity
      and the Memo Schedule for MD Party Victory Fund reported in the Year End report.
      I will be amending Year End report to clarify that Memo Schedule entries do
      relate partly to a Transfer in from the 30 day general report and from a transfer
      in expected in the next 3 months after the Year end reporting period. Also clarifying
      that the transfer in from the ASDC Partnership Program reported in the 30 day
      G report relates to Memo Schedules for ASDC Affinity Partnership Program reported
      in the October Monthly for the September activity.
