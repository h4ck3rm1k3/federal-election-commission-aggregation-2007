    H4 has been corrected to properly report the allocated activity and year-to-date
    totals for payments to the ?Grand Sierra Resort?, ?Thelma Matlin? and ?Amy Curtis-Webber?.
    There errors were due to a user error with the new reporting software.    *The
    committee received inaccurate advise from commission staff and consultants at
    the close of 2006 as to the appropriate 2007 fixed allocation ratio, and has applied
    the incorrect Non-Presidential and Non-Senate 15% fixed allocation ratio consistently
    since 1/1/2007.    Upon review and consultation with Commission staff, it is clear
    as pointed out by the Commission under 11 CFR 106.7(d)(2) and (3) that the appropriate
    fixed allocation ratio for these types of expenses for this committee in Nevada
    is Presidential Only Election Year 28% fixed allocation ratio.    This report
    amends the allocation items impacted by this global error. In this original report,
    the amount transferred from the non-federal to the allocation account was $6,867.80.
    The amount that should have been transferred based on this amended report is $5,675.22.    The
    committee will correct this overpayment by transferring $1,192.58 from the federal
    to the non-federal account on October 22, 2007.    This correction will also modify
    the ending cash totals that will be carried forward to the reports for the remainder
    of the year.          In March 2007 the Committee converted to an outside vendor
    for assistance in preparing reports for the Commission. While reviewing this report
    utilizing this new software tool, additional minor corrections were made to this
    report to better reflect the activities of the Committee during this reporting
    period.    ",""'
