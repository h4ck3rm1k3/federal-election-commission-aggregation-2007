  input: TEXT,SE24,SE24.4363,"Upon closer inspection of our records and after talking
    with Christopher J. Morse, Senior Campaign Finance Analyst for the FEC on April
    30, 2007, the Pennsylvania Pro-Life Federation Federal PAC is submitting the following
    response to an FEC letter dated April 18, 2007.  This memo is our response to
    the FEC's 1st question and an explanation of our report changes.  This independent
    expenditure ($1,144.83 to Erdman Advertising, Marketing & Design on behalf of
    Michael Fitzpatrick) was originally dated 10/19/06 and reported in our 2006 30
    Day Post General Report.  The FEC questioned whether the PA Pro-Life Federation
    Federal PAC should have filed a 24 hour report because of the date & dollar amount
    of the expenditure.  However, when we inspected our records we discovered that
    the actual mail date of the independent expenditure piece was 10/16/06 and therefore,
    needed to be reported in the 12 Day Pre-General Report and NOT the 30 Day Post-General
    Report.  And as a result it fell outside the 2-20 day period before the November
    election.  Therefore, the Pennsylvania Pro-Life Federation Federal PAC did not
    need to file a 24 hour report for this independent expenditure."
