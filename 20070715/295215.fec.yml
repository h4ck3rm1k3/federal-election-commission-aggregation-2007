  input: TEXT,F3PA,,"Please accept the Jingozian for President FEC forms in electronic
    format.  Due to terrible campaign advice from the campaign's former Campaign Manager
    and former Treasurer, we originally filed these forms in hard copy.  Also, we
    were told by two FEC representatives that hard copy was the preferred method of
    submission since we had no contributions.  However, we were later alerted to the
    fact that a loan to the campaign is considered a 'contribution.'  Even the FEC
    forms were a bit ambiguous regarding this matter.  We are not trying to assign
    blame or make excuses.  We just want to be sure that we are complying with FEC
    regulations.  As a matter of good faith and to learn more about FEC regulations,
    Mike Jingozian, Founder of RESET America and Libertarian Candidate for President,
    and I, Heather Marsh, acting Treasurer, will be traveling to Washington, DC, to
    attend the FEC Conference on Federal Campaign Finance Laws on May 10-11, 2007.  This
