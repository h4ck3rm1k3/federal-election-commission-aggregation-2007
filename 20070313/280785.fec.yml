    value: This disbursement is an exempt party activity.  This expenditure was not
      paid for by a national party committee transfer but rather was paid for from
      a segregated account of Federal state-raised dollars. No public advertising
      was used.  None of the funds were designated for a particular candidate.  This
      mass mailing is an issue advocacy - volunteer touched piece for Jim Gerlach
