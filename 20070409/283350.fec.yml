    request, dated 03/09/2007.    All totals have been corrected through this and
    previous amendments.    The expenses for polling on Schedule H4 did not meet the
    definition of Federal Election Activity.  It was for internal polling thart was
    not shared with any campaigns nor was it appended to the voter file.     The expenses
    for Voter ID Canvassing on Schedule H6 were incorrectly described.  These transactions
    should have been labeled as GOTV Canvassing, like the other transactions during
    this period.      This report does not disclose any transfers from the Levin account
    into the Federal account for anything other than Allocable FEA.",
