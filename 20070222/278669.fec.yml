  input: '"TEXT","F3XA","","The 2004 Post Election report was amended while the 2004
    Year End report was not, creating a discrepency in the cash on hand amount.  The
    Year End report has now been amended, changing the cash on hand amount for the
    2005 Pre-Election report on line 6(b) to $36,876.70, which equals the amount in
    line 6(a).  This change corrected the inconsistency on Line 8 between current
    reporting period and closing calendar year-to-date cash-on-hand, as was requested
    in a letter from the Commission dated January 24, 2007.  In addition, ACH deposits  totaling
    $16,392.00 were not calculated in line 6(c) of the original 2005 Pre-Election
    report and have been added to the amended report.  These deposits change the totals
    in lines 11(a)i and 11(a)ii, and therefore also change the totals in lines 11(a)iii,
    11(d), 19, and 20."'
