    value: This amended report corrects two issues; the first relates to an in-kind
      disbursement of 871.20 to Sen. Norm Coleman that that was re-designated to the
      08 General per the Coleman campaign upon our approval.  The second issue pertains
      to items that were designated to 2003 election year due to a data entry error.
      When the 2008 primary was created in our Vocus software the correct primary
      date of Nov 8 2008 was entered then an additional field asking for the year
      must be filled in and 2003 was inadvertently entered we have subsequently corrected
      this error and we will be amending reports through August 2007.  This amended
      report corrects those items reported for Jan 2007.
