    For the period of November 29 2006 through December 31 2006 there was an increase
    in the amount of distributions.  Upon transfer of the bookkeeping to a new accountant
    the original report was filed with the campaign records to date. After the review
    and balancing the campaign account against the bank statement it was determined
    additional distributions were made but were recorded once the funds cleared the
    bank. The distributions should have been recorded when the payment was made not
    when the funds cleared the bank.   2- Request-Decrease in amount of debts and
    receipts from original report. The debt was reinstated because of the debt was
    adjusted incorrectly on a previous amendment. I did not enter the transactions
    correctly. To reflect the payment of the debt the code in the software was changed
    to reflect the expense was no longer a debt. The correct way for NGP software
    was to adjust a debt when paid is to create an additional transaction and link
    the payment to the original transaction. An adjustment on a previous amendment
