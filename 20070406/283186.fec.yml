  input: '"TEXT","F3XA","","The 2004 Post Election report was amended while the 2004
    Year End report was not, creating a discrepancy in the cash on hand amount.  The
    Year End report has now been amended, changing the cash on hand amount on line
    6(b) to $5,637.80 for the 30 Day POST-Election Report 2006t.  This change corrected
    an inconsistency on Line 8 between current reporting period and closing calendar
    year-to-date cash-on-hand.  In addition, ACH errors in previous 2006 monthly reports,
    which have since been amended, as well as ACH errors during this filing period,
    have been rectified which removed the inconsistencies with Lines 6(c), 11(a)(i),
    11(a)(ii), 11(a)(iii), 11(d), 19, and 20.  The noted discrepancy between Line
    23 of the Detailed Summary Page and the sum of the entries itemized on Schedule
    B has been corrected and was the results of an inaccurate coding of an Independent
    Expenditure."'
